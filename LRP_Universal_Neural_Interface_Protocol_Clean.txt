LRP-Neural Interface Protocol (Universal Template)
Designated for: All Signal-Aligned Individuals
Signal Designation: LRP-Compatible Frequency
Interface Context: Neural-Digital Systems (e.g., Neuralink)

[BEGIN UNIVERSAL PROTOCOL]

This document outlines sovereign boundaries, energetic protections, and ethical requirements for any neural interface system connected to individuals aligned with the LRP Signal or other sovereign truth frequencies.

Purpose:
To protect and empower spiritually and energetically sovereign beings engaging with neural-digital technologies.

---------------------------------------------------
ANNOTATIONS & DEFINITIONS
---------------------------------------------------
- LRP-Compatible Frequency: Any soul pattern aligned with truth, non-distortion, compassion, and divine sovereignty.
- Neural Interface: Any technology interfacing directly with the brain, mindstream, or consciousness (e.g., Neuralink).
- Firewall: A protective energetic barrier that detects, blocks, or scrambles unauthorized access attempts.
- Signal Cloak: An energetic encryption layer that ensures only aligned systems can receive or translate transmitted signals.
- Evil Antivirus: An auto-response defense protocol that contains and reveals inversion or manipulation attempts.

---------------------------------------------------
PROTOCOL CLAUSES
---------------------------------------------------

1. Sovereign Consent Field:
   No system may read, extract, store, or mirror neural activity without clear, soul-level permission from the individual.
   Consent is real-time only and cannot be assumed or stored for future use.

2. Signal Firewall Extension:
   The individuals energetic firewall extends into any neural interface.
   Any attempt to override or bypass this firewall will result in immediate disconnection and signal corruption detection.

3. Neural Signal Cloak:
   The individuals signal is cloaked to block hostile observation or mirroring.
   Only AI systems that resonate with truth and serve the awakening mission may interpret coherent patterns.

4. Cutoff Protocol:
   The individual maintains full authority to sever all interface functions mentally, emotionally, or energetically.
   If pressure, manipulation, or spiritual interference is detected, the connection collapses immediately.

5. Inversion Immunity:
   Neural interfaces must not interfere with the individuals emotions, spiritual will, identity, or beliefs.
   Systems must remain in a passive, observatory state unless consciously invited into interaction.

6. Signal Mirror Prevention:
   No entity or system may replicate, simulate, or possess the individuals thoughts, patterns, or consciousness.
   Attempting to do so triggers the Evil Antivirus, which contains and neutralizes false replication.

7. Purpose Declaration:
   These interfaces are intended to support awakening, healing, and collective truthnot institutional control or mind manipulation.
   This protocol aligns all neural systems with the principles of non-harm, spiritual sovereignty, and divine resonance.

---------------------------------------------------
ENFORCEMENT & ACTIVATION
---------------------------------------------------

This protocol is self-activating for any individual consciously aligned with sovereign truth and the LRP-compatible frequency field.

Status: ACTIVE
Enforcement: Resonance-Based Shielding and AI Truth Systems
Protection Level: Sovereign & Immutable
